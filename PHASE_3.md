# Phase 3 — tracker and follow-ups

Spec: `PHASE_3_PROMPT.md` (verbatim). This file is the checklist and the place follow-ups get
written. Detailed engineering notes (deviations, measurements, fidelity) go in `NOTES.md`.

Legend: `[x]` done and verified · `[~]` partly done / needs a manual in-game check · `[ ]` not started

---

## §0 Scout — verified against the tree before starting

- [x] Phases 1–2 and RF Vision Steps 1–2 done; **161 tests** green; `rf` has 0 Minecraft imports
      (checked by grep).
- [x] Versions match the spec: `PROTOCOL_VERSION = "3"`, `SignalSamplePayload.VERSION = 2`,
      `AntennaBlockEntity.DATA_VERSION = 2`.
- [x] `Band.capacityTier` is read by nothing in `src/main` (only a Javadoc mention in `ServiceLevel`).
- [x] No recipes exist anywhere in `src/main/resources`.
- [x] `ReceiverStateStore<K>` is generic. Reuse it for fixed receivers (§3B.3).
- [x] `SurfaceProbe` already exists in `rf` (the solver's altitude aiding reuses it).
- [x] `CellParams.MAX_BAND_ID_LENGTH` exists and existing payloads cap band ids with it.
- [x] **Known problem 3 (datapack folders) confirmed from vanilla's own 1.21.1 jar:** vanilla ships
      `data/minecraft/loot_table/`, `recipe/`, `tags/block/`, `tags/item/`. RANCraft ships
      `loot_tables/` and `tags/blocks/`, which 1.21 no longer reads. Expected symptom: masts and
      sectors drop nothing in survival, and pickaxes are not their effective tool. Runtime check
      and fix happen in slice 1.
- [x] **Spec discrepancy, recorded as §8 of the prompt asks:** the prompt says "extend the existing
      zero-import grep assertion". **No such test exists.** Purity was only ever checked by hand
      with grep. Slice 1 creates the assertion test, covering `rf` now and `util` once it exists.
- [~] Vision Step 3a: the pure `DriveTestLog` + 19 tests exist in the session scratchpad, not in
      `src/`. Plan: land Step 3a first (the spec's recommendation), as slice 0.

## 3A done-when

- [ ] Meter and lens behave exactly as before the ticker refactor.
- [ ] Carrying the Locator costs no extra evaluation (EvaluationStats).
- [ ] Triangle of three masts → FIX with a sensible ±; three in a line → POOR GEOMETRY.
- [ ] Adding a band_3500 site visibly shrinks ±.
- [ ] Walking behind a hill visibly increases fix error.
- [ ] Rings render at measured ranges and pass through (or near) the player.
- [ ] Emergency record survives death and shows the estimate, not the true position.

## 3B done-when

- [ ] The nine-mast column reads as one cell, (0 co-channel), lobe at the top.
- [ ] Adding a mast to the top of a column keeps its PCI.
- [ ] A block placed 500 blocks away no longer invalidates a cached sample; one on the link path does.
- [ ] 200 radio links on a quiet server cost < 0.1 ms/tick in steady state (measured).
- [ ] A radio link drops updates at POOR and is solid at FAIR.
- [ ] Unloading a chunk stops its fixed devices; reloading resumes them.

## 3C done-when

- [ ] A tier-2 sector cannot use band_3500 until it gets a Wideband Radio Unit.
- [ ] With requireBackhaul on: three microwave-chained sites are on air; breaking the middle dish takes
      the far site off air and the lens greys it.
- [ ] A tree grown into a link path → DEGRADED, cells behind read BH: LIMITED, Storage Terminal stops,
      Radio Link keeps working.
- [ ] A marginal link drops in a thunderstorm and recovers after.
- [ ] Proximity Scanner works on band_3500 at GOOD, refuses on band_1800 with "needs tier 3".
- [ ] With requirePower on, a 30 dBm sector burns fuel ~7× faster than a 20 dBm one.
- [ ] Every block and item is craftable in survival and every block drops itself.
- [ ] With both logistics flags off (default), a Phase 2 world plays exactly as before.

## Follow-ups

Anything found along the way that is out of scope for the current slice goes here, with where it
came from.

- (from RF Vision Step 2) The Step 2 adversarial review stopped after round 1 (account usage limit).
  Round 1 fixes are applied; rounds 2+ never ran. Slice 4 rewrites the ticker's link-lens
  plumbing, so the Phase 3A review re-covers that code path.
